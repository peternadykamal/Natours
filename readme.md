- **Fully Implemented Authentication**: Natours uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication, ensuring secure access to user accounts and data. Users can sign up, log in, and reset their passwords using email.

- **Security Measures**:

  - **XSS Protection**: Natours mitigates XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks by sanitizing user input and escaping potentially dangerous characters.
  - **NoSQL Injection Prevention**: The app protects against NoSQL injection by removing or escaping characters that could be used maliciously in MongoDB queries.
  - **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP) Attacks Prevention**: Natours prevents HTTP parameter pollution by disallowing duplicate query parameters, ensuring request parameters are handled correctly.
  - **Rate Limiting and Brute-Force Attack Protection**: The app implements rate limiting to protect against brute-force attacks.

  - **JWT Token Expiration and Health Checks**: Natours ensures the security of JWT (JSON Web Tokens) by setting expiration dates for both authentication and password reset tokens. Additionally, the app performs health checks on tokens to verify their validity before granting access.

- **MVC Architecture**: Natours follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, separating concerns for better code organization and maintainability.

- **Descriptive Error Handling**: Both the frontend and backend of Natours feature descriptive error handling, ensuring users receive clear and informative error messages when issues occur.

- **Server-Side Rendering with Pug**: Natours utilizes server-side rendering with the Pug templating engine for efficient rendering of dynamic content.

- **Optimized Asset Delivery**: The app optimizes asset delivery by bundling JavaScript files, optimizing uploaded images for faster loading, and using compression to reduce file sizes.

Natours is designed with security, performance, and user experience in mind, providing users with a seamless and enjoyable booking platform.
